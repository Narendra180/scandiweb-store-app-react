cart: {
    products: {},
    totalQuantity: 0
}

cart {
    products: {
        productID: [{id,name,brand,prices,attributes,quantity:1,index: 0},
                    {id,name,brand,prices,attributes,quantity:1,index: 1}]
                    ,
        productID: [{id,name,brand,prices,attributes,quantity:1},
                    {id,name,brand,prices,attributes,quantity:1}]            
    }
}

logic:
=> If productID array does not have a product object with same 
   attributes as the product object that needs to be added then
   add the product object to the array else if the productID array
   has an object with same attributes as the product object that needs
   to be added then increment the quantity.
   use array length as index property when adding new object to array.
=> If there is no property with projectId then create it and initialize 
   it with empty array.
=> If there is a property with projectId and if the array is empty then 
   we can add the product object to the array.
